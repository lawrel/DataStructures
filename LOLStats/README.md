# LEAGUE OF LEGENDS STATS
number of hours: ~12

## DESCRIPTION OF 3RD STATISTIC: 
My statistics were an average kill per minute, average death per minute, and average kills/min to average 
death/min. My idea is that a skilled player should kill other players frequently and not die very often,
resulting in a large kills/min to death/min. Players are organized first by highest k/m:d/m, then highest
k/m, then lowest d/m, then alphabetically.

The two functions IsNotInList[TYPE] and findIndex[TYPE] are examples of where I had to expand
for different types because iterators are unallowed. 

This may not be important but originally I had one class and pretty messy parsing, so that is what
the many additional updates are.
